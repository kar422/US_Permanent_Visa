#In this  project  data set consist of  385,000 rows and 158 columns , 80 percent of the columns have missing values and I dropped them , remaining columns I filled the missing values with mode,some columns not available.


I used label enconder to convert text data to numerical data which will save time during execution.

I got class imbalance for target variable. 
I upsampled  the training set and tested on imbalance data.I used AUC-ROC as my metric to evaluate the model performance


I'm still working on the project , I will  increase features and fill the missing value with statictial imputational values  and run more machine learning algorithms .
